## Debatable Cuestions

* To what extent did the D-day invasion play a crucial role in turning the tide of World War II, and were there alternative strategies that could have been equally or more effective for the Allies?
* Did the United States' entry into World War II solely result from the attack on Pearl Harbor, or were there underlying factors and motivations that influenced this decision?
